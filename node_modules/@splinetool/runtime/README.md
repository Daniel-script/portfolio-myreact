# Spline Runtime

**runtime** allows you to run Spline scenes in javascript.

## Install

```bash
yarn add @splinetool/runtime
```

or

```bash
npm install @splinetool/runtime
```

## Usage

To use runtime, first you have to go to the Spline editor, click on the **Export** button, select "**Code**" and then "**Vanilla JS**".

You can copy the URL there and pass it to the `.load()` function:

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

// make sure you have a canvas in the body
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');

// start the application and load the scene
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode');
```

You should be able to see the scene you exported in your canvas.

> :warning: Only **.splinecode** files should be loaded through this API. `.spline` files are meant to be used in the editor.

### Read and modify Spline objects

You can query any Spline object via `findObjectByName` or `findObjectById`.

_(You can get the ID of the object in the `Develop` pane of the right sidebar)._

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline
	.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode')
	.then(() => {
		const obj = spline.findObjectByName('Cube');
		// or
		// const obj = spline.findObjectById('7AF5EBC0-09BB-4720-B045-F478F8053AA4');

		console.log(obj); // Spline Object => { name: 'Cube', id: '7AF5EBC0-09BB-4720-B045-F478F8053AA4', position: {}, ... }

		// move the object in 3D space
		obj.position.x += 10;
	});
```

### Listen to events

You can listen to any Spline Event you set in the Events panel of the editor by attaching a listener to the Spline instance.

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline
	.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode')
	.then(() => {
		spline.addEventListener('mouseDown', (e) => {
			if (e.target.name === 'Cube') {
				console.log('I have been clicked!');
			}
		});
	});
```

You can find a list of all of the Spline Event listeners in the [API](#api) section.

### Trigger Spline events from outside

You can trigger any animation Event you set in the Events panel in the Spline Editor.

You can use the `emitEvent` function, passing the [event type](#spline-events) and the name or ID of your object.

_(You can get the ID of the object in the `Develop` pane of the right sidebar)._

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline
	.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode')
	.then(() => {
		spline.emitEvent('mouseHover', 'Cube');
	});
```

Or you can query the spline object first, and then trigger the event:

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline
	.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode')
	.then(() => {
		const obj = spline.findObjectByName('Cube');
		objectToAnimate.emitEvent('mouseHover');
	});
```

You can find a list of all of the Spline Events you can pass to the `emitEvent` function in the [Spline Events](#spline-events) section.

### Preloading your scene

You might want to start the loading of `.splinecode` file before your code is loaded. It's possible using a [HTML preload Link tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/preload). Doing so will only save a little time by ensuring the spline file loading starts before your scripts are done loading. Since internally the `.splinecode` file will be loaded through a `fetch` call, you can do it like this :

```HTML
<html>
<head>
	<!--
		add a preload link tag
		with the scene your want to preload
		at the end of your <head>
		It needs to use the fetch preload type
	-->
	<link rel="preload" href="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode" as="fetch"
</head>
```

```js
/*
	When loading the Application, use the second
	param of the load function to make sure the browser
	will use the preloaded file and not make another request
*/
spline.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode', {
	credentials: 'include',
	mode: 'no-cors',
});
```

## API

### Spline Application Methods

You can call all these different methods on the Spline `Application` instance.

| Name                  | Type                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                         |

### Spline Events

These are all the Spline event types that you can pass to the `addEventListener`, `emitEvent` and `emitEventReverse` function.
